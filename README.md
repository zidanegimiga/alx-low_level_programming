This isn't my first time coding in C. I learnt it in 2017 but due to lack of constant practise and inconsistency, most of the  concepts have slipped out. 
I however used this opportunity to relearn it and it is so far one of my favourite languages. C is fun. 
Within this directory are the problems i solved while on my journey in C.
