# Arguments of the Main Function
-------------------------------------------
* In this directory, i learned that i could be able to pass arguments from the command line to the ``main()`` function.
*Two arguments namely ``argc`` and ``argv``are passed to the program. 
* ``argc`` represents the number of arguments passed to the program. So if you pass a value to a program, the value of argc would be two, one for for the argument the other for the program name.
*``argv`` stands for argument value.
