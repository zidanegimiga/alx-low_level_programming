### Debugging ###
When Grace Hopper was working on her Mark ii computer at Havard University, her associates discovered a moth in tthe relay that was impeding operation. When they removed it, she remarked that they were debugging the system.

ALX not only taught me how to write C programs but to also to find and fix errors that impeded them fro not running as eexpected. 

I learned how to use debugging tools such as gdb

I learned the debugging processes, techniques such as the remote debugging, post-mortem debugging and crash debugging.

I will demonstrate that through the projects in this directory.
