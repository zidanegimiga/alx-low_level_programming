# Static Libraries
----------------------------------------
Developed programs tend to grow larger and larger thereby increasing compilation time.
We then think about combining our source code into small units of related files that can be managed with a seperate markfile.

*Static Libraries are the result of the linker making copy of all used library functions to the executable file.
